# Cryptolab

This repository contains implementations of various Cryptographic primitives and protocols.

It's a scratchpad and serves as an R&D environment to play around with the whole gamut of constructions the Cryptography toolbox has to offer, some of which I also dive deeper into on [my personal website](https://muens.io).

Code you can find here was written for _educational and entertainment purposes only_&trade; and was **not audited**.

## Setup

1. `git clone <url>`
2. `deno test`
3. `deno task dev`

## Useful Commands

```sh
deno init

deno info
deno doc [<path>]
deno repl
deno bench <path>
deno compile [-A] <path>

deno fmt [<path>]
deno lint [<path>]
deno test [<path>]

deno run <path>

deno task dev
```
